Good candidates: statistics, legal/procedural statements (probate, divorce, taxes), market data, claims about government programs or regulations.
Bad candidates: the author's personal opinions or anecdotes, generic advice, anything about the author's own services, sentences already containing a markdown link.

Return ONLY a JSON array (no preamble, no code fence, no explanation before or after it) of at most ${LINK_CONFIG.maxClaimsPerDraft} objects, strongest candidates first:

[
  {
    "claim": "one-line restatement of the factual claim",
    "sentence": "the EXACT sentence from the draft, character-for-character, including punctuation",
    "search_query": "a web search query likely to find an authoritative source for this claim"
  }
]

Return [] if nothing in the draft merits an external citation. Do not invent sentences — every "sentence" value must appear verbatim in the draft.

${bodyMd}`;
